    "# Introduction to ACDCs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook introduces the concept of Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs). We'll explore what they are, their basic structure, and why they are a secure way to share information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Assumed Knowledge: You should already be familiar with concepts like Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), Key Event Logs (KELs), controllers, and basic cryptography like digital signatures.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an ACDC?\n",
    "\n",
    "In KERI, verifiable claims are exchanged using **Authentic Chained Data Containers**, **ACDCs** for short. An ACDC is like a digital envelope that's been cryptographically sealed. You can put data inside (like a name, an authorization, or a membership status), and the seal guarantees who created it and that the contents haven't been tampered with since it was sealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature of ACDCs is that they allow different parties (represented by their AIDs) to securely share and verify pieces of information or claims about themselves or others. They are KERI's secure implementation of the broader concept of Verifiable Credentials (VCs). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs)\n",
    "\n",
    "ACDCs rely on the concept of **Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs)** to create Identifiers for data. The SAID is generated by hashing the content it represents (after placing a placeholder for the SAID itself) and is then embedded back into that content, making the data and its identifier mutually tamper-evident. SAIDs are a crucial part of ACDCs and will be presented later in the definition of credential Schemas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of an ACDC\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an ACDC:\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸš§\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, an ACDC has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Envelope:** This contains metadata *about* the ACDC itself. Key pieces include:\n",
    "    * `v`: Specifies the version and serialization format (like JSON or CBOR).\n",
    "    * `d`: The unique identifier for *this specific ACDC instance*. This is a SAID\n",
    "    * `i`: The AID (Autonomic Identifier) of the entity that *issued* the ACDC.\n",
    "    * `s`: The SAID of the *Schema* that defines the structure and rules for the data inside this ACDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Payload:** This holds the information conveyed. It's typically structured into:\n",
    "    * `a` (Attributes): The core data or claims being made (e.g., name: \"Alice\", role: \"Admin\")\n",
    "    * `e` (Edges): Optional links to *other* ACDCs, creating verifiable chains of credentials \n",
    "    * `r` (Rules): Optional machine-readable rules or references to legal agreements (like Ricardian Contracts) associated with the credential \n",
    "\n",
    "*(We'll explore schemas, attributes, edges, and rules in detail in later notebooks.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## ACDCs Security and Verifiability\n",
    "\n",
    "ACDCs leverage KERI's core security principles to provide strong guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Authenticity:** Every ACDC is digitally signed by its issuer (`i` field). Using the issuer's KEL (Key Event Log), anyone can verify that the issuer actually created and authorized that specific ACDC.\n",
    "* **Integrity:** The ACDC's own identifier (`d` field) is a SAID. This means the identifier is a cryptographic hash (digest) of the ACDC's contents. If anything in the ACDC changes (even a single character), the SAID will no longer match, proving it has been tampered with.\n",
    "* **Schema Verification:** The schema defining the ACDC's structure is also identified by a SAID (`s` field). This ensures that everyone agrees on the structure and rules the credential must follow, and that the schema itself hasn't been tampered with.\n",
    "* **End-Verifiability:** Like all things in KERI, ACDCs are designed to be verifiable by anyone who receives them, relying only on the ACDC itself and the issuer's KEL, without needing to trust intermediaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make ACDCs a robust foundation for building trustable digital interactions, from simple claims to complex authorization workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the basic concept of an ACDC, the next step is to learn how to define their structure using **Schemas**. In the next notebook, we'll dive into creating ACDC schemas using JSON Schema and making them verifiable with SAIDs."
