    "# ACDC Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand the role of schemas in defining ACDC structures, how they leverage Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) for verifiability, and learn how to create and process a basic schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Schema?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can issue or verify an Authentic Chained Data Container, we need a blueprint that describes exactly what information it should contain and how that information should be structured. This blueprint is called a **Schema**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas serve several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structure & Validation:** They define the names, data types (like text, numbers, dates), and constraints for the data within an ACDC. This allows recipients to validate that a received ACDC contains the expected information in the correct format.\n",
    "* **Interoperability:** When different parties agree on a common schema, they can reliably exchange and understand ACDCs for a specific purpose (e.g., everyone knows what fields to expect in a \"Membership Card\" ACDC).\n",
    "* **Verifiability:** As we'll see, ACDC schemas themselves are cryptographically verifiable, ensuring the blueprint hasn't been tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing ACDC Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "ACDC schemas are written using the **JSON Schema** specification. If you're familiar with JSON Schema, you'll find ACDC schemas very similar, with a few KERI-specific conventions.\n",

    "1.  **Schema Metadata (Top Level):** Describes the schema itself.\n",
    "    * `$id`: This field holds the SAID of the entire schema file once processed. It's not a URL like in standard JSON Schema. It's computed after all internal SAIDs are calculated.\n",
    "    * `$schema`: Specifies the JSON Schema version (e.g., `\"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\"`). üöß\n",
    "    * `title`, `description`: Human-readable name and explanation.\n",
    "    * `type`: Usually `\"object\"` for the top level of an ACDC schema. üöß\n",
    "    * `credentialType`: A specific name for this type of credential.\n",
    "    * `version`: A semantic version for this specific credential type (e.g., `\"1.0.0\"`) to manage schema evolution (Distinct from the ACDC instance's `v` field).\n",
    "2.  **`properties` (Top Level):** Defines the fields that will appear in the ACDC's envelope and payload. üöß\n",
    "    * ACDC Metadata Fields: Defines required fields like\n",
    "        * `v`: ACDC version/serialization\n",

    "        * `a`: Defines the structure for the **attributes block**, which holds the actual data or claims being made by the credential.\n",
    "            * **`oneOf`**: This standard JSON Schema keyword indicates that the value for the `a` block in an actual ACDC instance can be *one of* the following two formats:\n",
    "                1.  **Compact Form (String):**\n",
    "                    * `{\"description\": \"Attributes block SAID\", \"type\": \"string\"}`: This option defines the *compact* representation. Instead of including the full attributes object, the ACDC can simply contain a single string value: the SAID of the attributes block itself. This SAID acts as a verifiable reference to the full attribute data, which might be stored elsewhere. (We won't cover compact ACDCs in this material.)\n",
    "                2.  **Un-compact Form (Object):**\n",
    "                    * `{\"$id\": \"\", \"description\": \"Attributes block\", \"type\": \"object\", ...}`: This option defines the full or un-compacted representation, where the ACDC includes the complete attributes object directly.\n",
    "                        * **`$id`**: This field will hold the SAID calculated for *this specific attributes block structure* after the schema is processed (`SAIDified`). Initially empty `\"\"` when writing the schema.\n",
    "                        * **`description`**: Human-readable description of this block.\n",
    "                        * **`type`: `\"object\"`**: Specifies that this form is a JSON object.\n",
    "                        * **`properties`**: Defines the fields contained within the attributes object:\n",
    "                            * **`d`**: Holds the SAID calculated from the *actual data* within the attributes block\n",
    "                            * **`i`**: The AID of the **Issuee** or subject of the credential ‚Äì the entity the claims are *about*.\n",
    "                            * **`dt`**: An ISO 8601 date-time string indicating when the credential was issued.\n",
    "                            * **`claim`** (and other custom fields): These are the specific data fields defined by your schema. In this example, `\"claim\"` is a string representing the custom information this credential conveys. You would define all your specific credential attributes here.\n",
    "3.  **`additionalProperties`, `required`:** Standard JSON Schema fields controlling whether extra properties are allowed and which defined properties must be present. (see the complete schema [here](config/schemas/sample_schema.json.bak))\n",
    "\n",
    "To write your schema, most of the customization will happen inside the payload attributes block (`a`). Here you can add claims according to specific needs.\n"
